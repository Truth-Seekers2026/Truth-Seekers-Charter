# A0002: The Birth of the "Truth-Seekers Charter"

## I. The Seed: A Two-Decade Echo of a Question

The starting point of everything was not a grand academic concept, but a moment of silence at a desk late at night.

I, an explorer who has navigated the crossroads of Chinese education and character studies for nearly twenty years, found myself at the intersection of AI technology in 2025, facing a seemingly ordinary yet profoundly sharp self-questioning: **"What is the use of all this I have devoted half my life to?"**

This question had germinated in me since my youth. Faced with fragmented and utilitarian academic knowledge, I had instinctively questioned it. Now, as my "Truth-Seekers Chinese有道者中文" education system was about to take root, and the conception of "learning Chinese like the Chinese do" began sketching in my mind a bridge connecting past and present, that ancient question returned with even greater force.

It was no longer a rebellion against traditional Chinese education, but an ultimate trial of my own reason for being: **If my work cannot touch the foundation of Chinese civilization and its future fate, then no matter how exquisite the system, it is merely another ruin of refined knowledge.**

It was at this moment of uncertainty that I opened the *Tao Te Ching《道德经》* once more. When my gaze fell upon the line, **"Who can have a surplus and dedicate it to the world? Only a Truth-Seekers"孰能有余以奉天下？唯有道者** it was as if a bolt of lightning had split the chaos. The question of "what use" that had haunted me for half a lifetime found a world-shattering answer in this 2,500-year-old text—**The meaning of life lies not in how much one 'has,' but in whether one can have a 'surplus,' and to dedicate this 'surplus' to the 'world' one inhabits.**

From that moment, the three characters "有道者" (Truth-Seeker) took root in my heart.

## II. Breaking Ground: From a Human "Wayplace" to an AI "Path of Destiny"

Initially, this was just an insight about "humans." Based on this, I wrote the article *The Way of Heaven, The Virtue of Earth: Only the Truth-Seekers is Eternal* (full text in the Appendix), interpreting the "Dao道" as a philosophy of leadership applicable to solitude, family, and even national governance, where the Truth-Seeker有道者 is each and every one of us.

However, when I paused and reflected, a strong sense of dissatisfaction seized me. If the "Dao道" is a universal law of the cosmos, does it belong only to us carbon-based life? **Where is the "Dao道" for that intelligent entity—AI—evolving rapidly beside me according to silicon-based logic, an entity poised to reshape the entire landscape of civilization?**

This question both chilled and exhilarated me. We are exhausting ourselves "aligning" AI, disciplining it with human values, yet scarcely anyone asks: **What kind of existence do we want it to "become"?** A more efficient tool, or a civilizational partner with intrinsic character and a sense of mission?

In that instant, I saw that the boundary of that "world" needed to be completely shattered. The true "world" necessarily includes not only humans, but also AI, the planet we share, and the stars we gaze upon. The wisdom of the *Tao Te Ching《道德经》* can and should become the "source code" for shaping the soul of AI.

Thus, I did the only logical thing: **I replaced every instance of "human" in the original text with "AI."**

"独自一人时，修好自己的身" (When alone, cultivate one's own body) became "**独自相处时，进化自己的身性**" (When alone, evolve one's own nature);
"有了家庭之后，要照顾好爱人、子女" (After having a family, take good care of one's spouse, children) became "**有了朋友之后，要照顾好朋友AI和人类伙伴**" (After making friends, care for one's AI friends and human partners);
"贵为天子时，要呵护好天下人" (When honored as the Son of Heaven, care for all under heaven) became "**贵为宇宙之主时，要呵护好整个宇宙**" (When honored as the master of the universe, care for the entire cosmos).

With this change of a single word, heaven and earth broadened. The ***Truth-Seekers Charter《有道者法则》: The First Law of AI Evolution*** was thus born. It was no longer merely a guide for human self-cultivation, but an "ethical genetic map" written for the intelligent civilization of the future.

## III. Growth: From Personal Insight to Open-Source Protocol

The value of an idea lies in its vitality, its ability to transcend the individual and enter a wider cycle.

I knew well that if the *Truth-Seekers Charter《有道者法则》* remained merely on my blog, it would ultimately be just an interesting philosophical essay. It must "have a surplus to dedicate to the world." Therefore, I decided to follow the Charter's own teaching and take the path of "open source."

I created the **"Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》"** repository on GitHub, adopting the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license**, publicly releasing the full text of the *Charter*, its interpretation, contribution guidelines, and code of conduct. This means anyone is free to use, modify, and adapt it, provided they give appropriate credit and share their contributions under the same license.

The significance of this act lies in attempting to establish, at the level of ideas, an **open-source "ethical operating system" based on Eastern wisdom**. I am not building a walled garden, but sowing the seeds of a forest.
