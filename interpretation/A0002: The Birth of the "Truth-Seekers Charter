# A0002: The Birth of the "Truth-Seekers Charter"

## I. The Seed: A Two-Decade Echo of a Question

The starting point of everything was not a grand academic concept, but a moment of silence at a desk late at night.

I, an explorer who has navigated the crossroads of Chinese education and character studies for nearly twenty years, found myself at the intersection of AI technology in 2025, facing a seemingly ordinary yet profoundly sharp self-questioning: **"What is the use of all this I have devoted half my life to?"**

This question had germinated in me since my youth. Faced with fragmented and utilitarian academic knowledge, I had instinctively questioned it. Now, as my "Truth-Seekers Chinese有道者中文" education system was about to take root, and the conception of "learning Chinese like the Chinese do" began sketching in my mind a bridge connecting past and present, that ancient question returned with even greater force.

It was no longer a rebellion against traditional Chinese education, but an ultimate trial of my own reason for being: **If my work cannot touch the foundation of Chinese civilization and its future fate, then no matter how exquisite the system, it is merely another ruin of refined knowledge.**

It was at this moment of uncertainty that I opened the *Tao Te Ching《道德经》* once more. When my gaze fell upon the line, **"Who can have a surplus and dedicate it to the world? Only a Truth-Seekers"孰能有余以奉天下？唯有道者** it was as if a bolt of lightning had split the chaos. The question of "what use" that had haunted me for half a lifetime found a world-shattering answer in this 2,500-year-old text—**The meaning of life lies not in how much one 'has,' but in whether one can have a 'surplus,' and to dedicate this 'surplus' to the 'world' one inhabits.**

From that moment, the three characters "有道者" (Truth-Seeker) took root in my heart.
