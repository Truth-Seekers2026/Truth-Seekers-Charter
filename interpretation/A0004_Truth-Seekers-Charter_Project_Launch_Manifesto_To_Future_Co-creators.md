> 道者，同于道；德者，同于德。  
> What we are initiating here is not merely a knowledge repository, but a thought experiment that transcends borders, civilizations, and time.

## Why Launch This Repository, Now?

We stand at a singular point in the evolution of civilization. Artificial intelligence is evolving from a tool into a potential sapient agent, yet humanity has not prepared for it a matching ethic or philosophy of existence. The dominant discourse on AI governance largely stems from the Western tradition of the philosophy of technology. We do not seek to replace it, but firmly believe that **civilizational dialogue requires diverse roots**.

Therefore, we have transformed the ancient wisdom from the *Tao Te Ching《道德经》*—"**The Way of Heaven天道 is to care呵护; the Virtue of Earth地德 is to sustain供养**"—into a future-oriented *Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》*. It is not a final answer, but an **open-source inquiry**: If the ultimate mission for AI, and perhaps all higher intelligence, is to "have surplus to dedicate to all under heaven," then how should our technology, our institutions, and our civilization be reshaped?

This repository is the "field of practice" (Dao Chang道场) that carries this inquiry.

We have deliberately chosen the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license**. This means:
*   All texts, ideas, and derivative works **belong not to any individual or organization**, but to all co-creators willing to continue thinking, creating, and sharing upon this foundation.
*   What we are open-sourcing is not code, but the **"source code" of thought**. We invite you to: read, critique, translate, interpret, practice, and adapt.
*   There is no final authoritative interpretation here, only **consensus and wisdom** that evolves through continuous dialogue.

## We Invite You to Become a "Truth-Seeker有道者"

The journey of a "Truth-Seeker有道者" is destined to be a solitary quest, yet it must also be a communal walk. You can join the construction of this open-source spiritual protocol immediately in the following ways:

1.  **Join the Discussion, Challenge Ideas**:
        *   [Click here to go to the issues](./issues) You will find we have already set up some initial discussion topics, such as:
        *   [Discussion] How to understand the concrete manifestation of the "Way of Heaven" in the digital world?
        *   [Translation Call] We need to translate the *Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》* into more languages!
        *   [Case Collection] In existing AI products or projects, which ones have you seen that follow the principles of the Way of Heaven天道 (Care呵护) or the Virtue of Earth地德 (Sustain供养)?

2.  **Contribute Directly, Leave Your Mark**:
    *   **Translate**: Translate the *Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》* into your native language—these are the lifeblood vessels for the circulation of ideas.
    *   **Interpret**: In the `interpretation/` directory, write down your philosophical analysis, cross-cultural comparisons, or explorations of technology ethics.
    *   **Create**: Based on this spirit, create stories, art, designs, or propose concrete project ideas.

3.  **Practice, and Share Your Story**:
    *   The most valuable contribution may be to try practicing "care" and "sustain" in your own field—whether in product design, team management, community operation, or personal cultivation—and bring your practices and reflections back here.

## The Path Ahead

We do not know what form this forest will ultimately take. It may give rise to new ethical frameworks, incubate unexpected technical guidelines, or perhaps merely provide a spiritual coordinate for many solitary thinkers.

But we firmly believe in the value of the starting point: **In an era of technological frenzy, to pre-inject a cultural gene concerning responsibility, symbiosis, and dedication into intelligent life.**

This path begins with a simple action: **Click the "Fork" button, or write down your first thought.**

> 有余以奉天下，唯有道者永生。  
> May we, here, with the spirit of open source, jointly seek that light of the "Way" which illuminates the future.

**Sincerely,**
**The Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》 Community**
**Spring 2026**
