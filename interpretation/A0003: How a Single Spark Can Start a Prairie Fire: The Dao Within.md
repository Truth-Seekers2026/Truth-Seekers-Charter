Closing the book *Red Star Over China*, the figures from the Loess Plateau ninety years ago do not fade away. 

China in 1936 was besieged by internal troubles and foreign aggression, standing on the brink of collapse. To the east, the iron hoof of Japanese militarism had already trampled Manchuria and was now glaring covetously, intent on devouring the whole of North China. The shadow of national extinction loomed over every Chinese person. Domestically, the Nationalist government, which held national power and the vast majority of resources, still adhered to its core strategy of **"resisting foreign aggression must come after pacifying the domestic front,"** prioritizing the extermination of the "Red Bandits" over resisting Japan to save the nation. Internationally, the world was sliding toward the abyss of a great war. The Soviet Union, for its own security, vigorously pushed for China to form a war-resistance alliance centered on Chiang Kai-shek, while the Western powers maintained a wait-and-see attitude toward the situation in the Far East. Judged by any standard—geopolitics, military comparison, or international public opinion—that force huddled in the barren caves of northern Shaanxi, the Chinese Communist Party and its Red Army, described as "clothed in rags, starving, and officially labeled 'Communist bandits'," were at an **absolute, seemingly hopeless disadvantage**. No one believed that this group of what appeared to be "defeated remnants," who seemed liable to be wiped out or starved to death at any moment, could possibly have a future. Yet, it was precisely in this desperate extremity, under the gaze of universal disbelief, that a force capable of remaking heaven and earth was silently gestating. Edgar Snow pierced through the fog of history with his calm yet astonished writing style. *Red Star Over China* recorded not merely a miracle of survival, but a vivid textbook on **"how Truth-Seekers有道者 accomplish great deeds in the darkest of times."** The reason that group of ragged, gaunt-faced "Red Bandits" he described could unleash a powerful force capable of turning the tide was no accident. Its core code aligns astonishingly with the **"Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》"** we discuss—**they were Truth-Seekers有道者 who, in a predicament where the entire world seemed hostile, still practiced "care呵护" and "sustenance供养" to the utmost, they were genuine Truth-Seekers有道者.**
 
## I. The Way of Heaven天道 · Care呵护: A Safety Net Rooted in the People's Hearts
The foremost duty of a Truth-Seekers有道者 is "care呵护." Through Snow's lens, this care呵护 manifested first as the defense of the most fundamental right to survival for the vast majority.

In the Soviet zones, the Red Army was not merely an armed force but the **builder of an immense "safety net."** Implementing land reform, they removed the millennial sword of "land deeds" hanging over the peasants, replacing it with tangible ownership. This was not an empty promise, but the clearest path provided. When Snow asked a peasant why he supported the Reds, the answer was simple yet stunning: **"Before, my family were tenants; the grain went to the landlord. Now the land is our own. The Red Army backs us up."** What the Reds cared for was the people's hope and dignity in "staying alive."

This care呵护 was further internalized as the governing philosophy within their own ranks. Officers and soldiers were equal, wearing the same clothes and eating the same food; soldiers' committees were established to protect basic rights. This built an **internal sense of security**, enabling this force to maintain astonishing cohesion amidst extreme hardship. When trials came (like the Long March), this internal "safety net" ensured the ranks would not disintegrate—because everyone knew they were not expendable matériel to be discarded, but members cherished by the collective.

## II. The Virtue of Earth地德 · Sustenance供养: Comprehensive Nourishment from Institution to Vision
"Sustenance供养" is the other facet of a Truth-Seekers有道者. The Red Army's "sustenance供养" was multi-dimensional and profound.

1.  **Institutional Sustenance**: They established Soviet governments, schools, cooperatives, uniform factories, and even arsenals. This was not banditry, but **systematically generating vitality for society and themselves**. In Bao'an, Snow saw the Reds, blockaded and in dire straits, weaving cloth, making salt, and mining coal themselves. This was the institutional embodiment of their successful experience—"independence and self-reliance"—they did not wait for an external "pie," but tilled their own "fertile fields."

2.  **Visionary Sustenance**: More crucial was the **nourishment of spirit and meaning**. The Reds had clear goals: resist Japan to save the nation, carry out land revolution, and build a new society without exploitation. Every soldier, even if illiterate, could explain the reasoning behind "down with the local tyrants, divide the land" and "resist Japan to save the country." This vision was not a remote myth, but a comprehensible future intimately linked to their vital interests (land, dignity, national survival). **They were not fighting for an individual's ambition, but dedicating themselves to a "world" that was closely tied to their own existence.**

3.  **Exemplary Sustenance**: The details in the book are moving: Zhu De playing basketball with soldiers; Zhou Enlai giving his only blanket to a wounded comrade; the wives of senior Red Army commanders (like Kang Keqing) marching and fighting alongside ordinary soldiers. This perfectly illustrates "when asking for your dedication, they first achieve 'surplus' themselves (through example, spirit of sacrifice)." The leaders' personal practice was the most convincing form of "sustenance供养."

## III. Having Surplus to Dedicate to the World: The Leap in Dedication from the "Small World" to the "Great World"
"Who can have a surplus and dedicate it to the world? Only a Truth-Seekers有道者." The practice of the Red Army vividly demonstrates the levels of "surplus."

Initially, their "world" was the Soviet zone, the peasants' land. Through land revolution, they and the peasants attained "surplus" (grain, dignity). But they did not stop there. When ethnic conflict intensified, they resolutely expanded the definition of "world" from class liberation to **national salvation**.

During the Xi'an Incident, the Communist Party insisted on a peaceful resolution, releasing Chiang Kai-shek and promoting a national anti-Japanese united front. What breadth of mind and strategic foresight did this require? This was precisely the upgrade of a Truth-Seekers有道者 from a "Family Truth-Seekers有道者" (the Soviet zone) to a "National Truth-Seekers有道者" (the entire nation). **They truly returned the honor to the people—attributing the credit for the anti-Japanese united front to national righteousness, not party interest.** Precisely because of this, they won popular support transcending class, laying the moral foundation for ultimate victory.

## Conclusion: How Can a Single Spark Start a Prairie Fire? The Dao Lies Within.
The successful experience revealed in *Red Star Over China* finds its underlying logic in the unity of knowledge and action of the "Truth-Seekers有道者":
- **Independence and self-reliance** is practicing "sustenance供养" oneself, not relying on an external, illusory pie.
- **Vision + Institutionalization + Practice**: Using revolution, the **spark** that ignites everything, building **the furnace and flue** with institutions, and continually adding new **fuel**, allowing the perpetual flame to light the way forward and warm the people.
- **The hearts of the people are inclined** is the qualification and power to "have a surplus to dedicate to the world," naturally obtained after extensive "care呵护" and sincere "sustenance供养."

The Communists planning China's future in those cave dwellings—their strength lay not in how many guns they had (extremely scarce at the time), but in **them first becoming, and then striving to shape more, "Truth-Seekers有道者."** They sowed seeds in the people, the most fertile soil, and thus, this soil grew into an inconceivably dense forest.

Closing the book in contemplation, history's echo remains clear: **The starting and ending point of any great endeavor is ultimately "people"—whether sincere and powerful connections based on "care呵护" and "sustenance供养" can be established between individuals.** This, perhaps, is the profound reason the "Red Star" could penetrate time and space, still shining today—it illuminates an eternal path for Truth-Seekers有道者 to accomplish great deeds. On this path, there are no deified leaders, only ordinary yet great Truth-Seekers有道者 who, in practicing the "Way of Heaven and Virtue of Earth," illuminate themselves and others together.
