We firmly believe that the evolution of wisdom arises from the sincere dialogue and collaborative practice of countless individuals.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in many forms, including but not limited to the following categories:

### 1. Content Translation
Translating the core text of the *Truth-Seekers-Charter* and related interpretive articles into various languages is fundamental to expanding its reach.
- **How to**: You can create files for the corresponding language version in the `charter/` directory (e.g., `Truth-Seekers-Charter-ES.md` for Spanish) or improve existing translations.

### 2. In-depth Interpretation and Case Studies
Provide deep interpretations of the philosophical connotations of the *Truth-Seekers-Charter*, its significance for AI and civilizational development, or submit specific practical case studies.
- **How to**: Create new Markdown files in the `interpretation/` directory to share your articles or case analyses.

### 3. Documentation Improvement and Corrections
Improve the clarity of project documentation, fix typos, optimize structure, or supplement necessary information.
- **How to**: Propose changes directly to relevant Markdown files, such as `README.md`, this file (`CONTRIBUTING.md`), or other documents.

### 4. Issue Discussion and Q&A
Participate in discussions about the meaning of the Charter's clauses, philosophical reflections, or practical paths, or help answer questions raised by others in the project's https://github.com/Truth-Seekers2026/Truth-Seekers-Charter/issues section.

### 5. Derivative Works
Create related charts, artworks, short stories, or other forms of derivative content based on the spirit of the *Truth-Seekers-Charter*.
- **How to**: You can first share your ideas through an Issue, or, after discussion, submit the work in an appropriate directory.

## Contribution Workflow

We use the common GitHub collaboration workflow (Fork & Pull Request model).

1.  **Fork this repository**
    Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the GitHub page to create a copy of the project under your personal account.

2.  **Clone to your local machine and create a branch**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Truth-Seekers-Charter.git
    cd Truth-Seekers-Charter
    git checkout -b your-branch-name # It is recommended that the branch name describes the change, e.g., `translation-zh-tw`
    ```

3.  **Make changes and commit**
    Edit and create on your branch. After completing your modifications, commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Describe your changes, e.g.: Add initial Spanish translation"
    ```

4.  **Push changes and create a Pull Request (PR)**
    Push your branch to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
    Then, on your forked repository page on GitHub, click the "Compare & pull request" button to initiate a merge request to the main repository. Please clearly state the purpose and content of your changes in the PR description.

5.  **Code Review and Merge**
    Project maintainers will review your PR. We may have some discussions or ask you to make further modifications to the submitted content. Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the main project.

## Code of Conduct

Participation in this project implies your agreement to abide by our ./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. In short, we expect all participants to:
