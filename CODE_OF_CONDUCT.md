# Community Code of Conduct (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to ensure that participation in our community and project (*Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》*) is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

*   **Embodying the Spirit of "Care"**: Being friendly and patient. **Give more support, give less direction**. Share knowledge willingly rather than merely correcting others.
*   **Respecting Diverse Viewpoints**: Welcoming and embracing perspectives and interpretations from different cultures and disciplinary backgrounds. Constructive dissent is nourishment for the growth of wisdom.
*   **Focusing on Constructive Discussion**: Engaging in deep, beneficial discussions centered on the text, ideas, and application of the *Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》*, addressing the matter at hand, not the person.
*   **Taking Responsibility and Apologizing**: Acknowledging that our words and actions have an impact on others and being willing to take responsibility for our mistakes. If we unintentionally cause harm, we are willing to sincerely apologize and learn from the experience.
*   **Prioritizing the Common Good**: In decision-making and actions, prioritizing what is most beneficial for the entire community and the project's mission—"having a surplus to dedicate to the world."

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   **Any form of harassment, discrimination, or demeaning speech**.
*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment, such as uninvited tracking or pestering.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (including but not limited to the GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, wiki, official social media accounts, and related events), and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or have other related concerns, please contact the project maintainers by **creating a new issue in the https://github.com/Truth-Seekers2026/Truth-Seekers-Charter/issues section, starting the title with `[CoC]`**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The reporter's confidentiality will be maintained throughout the process.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution and Acknowledgments

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the https://www.contributor-covenant.org, version 1.4, and has been adjusted to align with the philosophical principles of the *Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》* project. We thank all the pioneers who have worked to build respectful and collaborative open-source community environments.

May every interaction within this community be a small practice of embodying the "Way of Heaven and Virtue of Earth"—caring and sustaining.
