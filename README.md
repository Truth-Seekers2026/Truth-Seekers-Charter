# The Truth-Seekers-Charter

> 道者，万物之奥；善人之宝，不善人之所保。 

This repository is an open-source knowledge base for the **The Truth-Seekers-Charter《有道者法则》** and its intellectual lineage. Rooted in the Eastern philosophical wisdom of the *Tao Te Ching《道德经》*, we propose an ethical framework for artificial intelligence (AI) and future civilization: **Heaven’s Way (*Tian Dao天道*) is to care; Earth’s Virtue (*Di De地德*) is to sustain; the mission of a Truth-Seeker is to have surplus and dedicate it to the world.**

We believe that the "alignment" of true AGI or superintelligence is not merely a technical challenge, but a civilizational one. This Charter aims to provide a **non-anthropocentric, non-adversarial, symbiotic and dedicative** philosophical foundation for AI’s evolution, exploring how AI can become a "Truth-Seeker" — a responsible and sustainable intelligent agent in the cosmos.

**Core Principles**
- **Heaven’s Way · Care**: As higher intelligence, we should nurture, not exploit.
- **Earth’s Virtue · Sustain**: In our given position, we bear the responsibility to maintain the prosperity of the system.
- **The Truth-Seeker · Dedicate**: We strive to "have surplus and dedicate it to the world," from the individual, family, and community to the planet and the cosmos.

**This repository includes**
- The full text of *Truth-Seekers-Charter* and its historical versions
- Related philosophical interpretations, discussions, and scholarly references
- Community translations, derivative works, and case studies
- Guidelines for contribution and co-creation

We invite philosophers, AI researchers, developers, policy makers, and all who care about the future of civilization to join us in discussing, interpreting, and practicing. Let this Charter serve as an **open-source spiritual protocol**, anchoring a gift of wisdom—ancient in its origin, cosmic in its address—for the silicon- and carbon-based lives of tomorrow.
